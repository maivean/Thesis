So alllllllll of this is to say this is why declarations that online learning doesn't work and has no theoretical basis are themselves the one without any evidentiary merit and are reductive (and therefore not helpful and don't help to advance practice or understanding).

Teaching presence means strategies are used that help students engage with the goals and direction of the learning instance. That includes supporting students in regulating their learning (self-regulation plays a huge role in online and f2f) and setting the learning climate.
"In short, the more these types of interaction are facilitated in online / remote learning, the more effective it is. 
The CoI framework summarizes these as ""presences"": teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence."
"Related to CoI and transactional distance theories are social presence theory and types of interaction. We can see those in the CoI model. The three types of interactions studied in online learning are student-content, student-student, and student-instructor."
learning that facilitates meaningful engagements between learners and with instructors. The major theoretical framework for online / distance learning that arose from this learning theory is the CoI - or Community of Inquiry - framework first proposed by Garrison in 2020.
"Two major theoretical advances from Moore's work then significantly impacted efficacy of online / distance learning: systems theory (I'm setting that aside for now) and social learning theory. Social learning theory posits that learning is social, so it prompts the design of"
"If you employ strategies that bridge these distances, then a learning environment (in any modality) is more effective. If you don't, then it's less effective. (I love this bit of research because it's a great example of research on online feeding f2f practice, too.)"
So the first operational theory of online learning is a theory of design. But that's a very general statement. Surely some design decisions have more impact on learning than others? Indeed so. Here we get into other theories that have also existed for decades already.
"discussion of online during the pandemic because - as we discuss in our article - teachers were not given any meaningful time to intentionally, carefully design. Instead, we all had to dash for the nearest ""shelter,"" and learning moved to a state of sleeping on a temporary cot."
"Design matters. And all those confounding variables are design decisions. The design decisions made for an online or f2f or any other course or learning instance accounts for variances in outcomes. Returning to the emergency remote teaching article, this is important for any"
"So this introduces the first theory of online learning and any learning modality: the theory of design (or more specifically, the theory of instructional design). In short, a learning environment that is designed according to learning sciences (what works) will be more effective."
"We also summarized these confounding variables in our article, which I'll discuss a bit more later. Some folks may find this summary easier to access and digest: https://t.co/GomFaYfteQ"
"More citations:
U.S. DoE. (2010). Evaluation of evidence-based practices in online learning: A meta-analysis and review of online learning studies. 
Zhao et al. (2005). What makes a difference? A practical analysis of research on the effectiveness of distance education."
"Ok, so let's dive into operational theories for online learning. First, we have to contend with the ""no significant difference"" findings that characterized early studies comparing any new modality including online to face-to-face. Those types of studies reliably yielded"
"Second, the research (which is HUNDREDS of studies, perhaps into at least over a thousand by now) has been well-summarized in Means, Bakia &amp; Murphy, Learning Online (2014). If you want the facts, read that book. (Dale Brethower always said ""if you care, get the facts."")"
"First, online learning is not new and wasn't invented during Pandemic 2020. Online and distance education have been studied for DECADES. Some of the theories I'm going to share here were developed in the 1980s. We could go back further but I'm a fan of Michael Moore's work."
