      "Related to CoI and transactional distance theories are social presence theory and types of interaction. We can see those in the CoI model. The three types of interactions studied in online learning are student-content, student-student, and student-instructor.\n",

      "If you employ strategies that bridge these distances, then a learning environment (in any modality) is more effective. If you don't, then it's less effective. (I love this bit of research because it's a great example of research on online feeding f2f practice, too.)\n",
      "So the first operational theory of online learning is a theory of design. But that's a very general statement. Surely some design decisions have more impact on learning than others? Indeed so. Here we get into other theories that have also existed for decades already.\n",
