🎮 A game: Worddle
🗒️ Note taking app: Evernote

"@RepTroyNehls Then follow the lead of Virginia, where you can read the complete Standards of Learning online, by subject &amp; by grade. FIY teachers don't have time for tangents."
@BaskyCase Ugh sorry to hear that shit hasn't improved in the 10 years since I was last in college. It's super frustrating especially in fields like computer science that are practically made for online classes if professors would just let go of this bonkers idea that busywork = learning.
